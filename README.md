# Material Collapsing Toolbar Layout Design
Im going to show you how to create a CollapsingToolbarLayout one of the most amazing feature in material design libary.

### Description
One of the most amazing things about Design Support Library is that we can create lively animated UIs with some simple configuration in XML. No code nor deep control about scrolls is required, so the process becomes really easy.

We know that the Coordinate System is the central point for other components to work properly, and that AppBarLayout helps toolbars and other components to help shift the changes. I also showed you very easily how to use the Crumb Toolbar Layout to create a great effect for you.

### Usage
Just have a look at the code, or better still, clone it to a local repository in your machine:

git clone
```
https://github.com/umutsoysl/Material-Collapsing-Toolbar.git
```
and open it in Android Studio. Feel free to create pull requests to improve the implementation or documentation so it will help others. 

Give me a star if you find it useful! Another great milestone in my Simple series. Enjoy!
